# Cat vs Dog Image Classifier

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop an image classification model that can classify images as either cats or dogs using deep learning techniques in Python. The project was undertaken as part of an internship at Bharat Intern.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the "Dogs vs. Cats" dataset, which is publicly available on Kaggle. It consists of a large collection of images of cats and dogs labeled accordingly.

## Methodology

### Data Loading and Exploration
- The dataset was loaded into a Pandas DataFrame to understand its structure and distribution of cat and dog images.

### Data Preprocessing
- Image data was resized to a standard size and converted to grayscale or RGB format as required.
- Label encoding was performed to convert categorical labels (cats and dogs) into numerical format (0 for cats, 1 for dogs).

### Model Architecture
- A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture was chosen for image classification tasks.
- The model architecture consisted of convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
- Techniques such as dropout and batch normalization were employed to prevent overfitting.

### Model Training
- The dataset was split into training and test sets with an appropriate ratio.
- The CNN model was trained on the training data using techniques like stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam optimizer.

### Model Evaluation
- The model's performance was evaluated on the test set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- A confusion matrix was plotted to visualize the true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

## Results
- **Accuracy**: The model achieved a high accuracy score, indicating its effectiveness in classifying images as cats or dogs.
- **Confusion Matrix**: The confusion matrix showed a low number of misclassifications, confirming the model’s robustness.

## Conclusion
The Cat vs. Dog image classifier developed in this project performs well in distinguishing between images of cats and dogs. The use of CNN architecture, data preprocessing techniques, and appropriate model training contributed to the model’s success. This project not only enhances understanding of deep learning techniques but also provides a practical tool for image classification tasks.

## Future Work
To further improve the model, future work could explore:
- Fine-tuning the CNN architecture by adjusting hyperparameters or using pre-trained models like VGG, ResNet, or Inception.
- Augmenting the training data with techniques like rotation, flipping, or zooming to improve model generalization.
- Deploying the model as a web or mobile application for real-time classification tasks.
